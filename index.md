### CPSC 120 – Favorite Labs

---

### **Lab 1**
In this lab, we learned the basics of Linux, the Bash shell, and GitHub. I practiced navigating directories, editing files, compiling C++ code, and using Git to track changes. It was fun to run the “Hello World!” program and then change it to print my name. I also learned how to create commits, push changes to GitHub, and see my work online. Overall, it was a good introduction to the tools we’ll be using in this class.

### **Lab 8**
Lab 8 was a favorite because it challenged me to use loops and functions to solve real-world style problems, such as calculating fair judge scores. I enjoyed implementing the Olympic Judge Average function since it required validating command-line input, processing vectors, and handling edge cases, which strengthened my understanding of C++ functions and control flow. Additionally, creating patterns with nested loops was cool to do because I could visualize the output, experiment with loops, and see immediate results, which helped me improve my debugging skills.

### **Lab 9**
In this lab, I learned how to create a simple spell checker in C++. I practiced reading files, storing words in vectors, and checking whether each word is in a dictionary. I also got more experience with command-line arguments and handling errors when a filename isn’t provided. Implementing the MisspelledWords function helped me think about how to compare lists efficiently. I enjoyed testing the program with different text files and seeing which words were flagged as misspelled. This lab reinforced my understanding of file I/O, vector operations, and basic program structure in C++.
